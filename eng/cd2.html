                                            but war forgot to give us bread to eat<br>
                                            and for bread was the war<br>
                                            for bread were the battles<br>
                                            for bread death in the trenches<br>
                                            and prayers in the churches</p>
    
                                        <p>and for freedom was the war<br>
                                            for freedom rang the bells<br>
                                            and millions of young heads layed down in the ground<br>
                                            but war forgot top put down martyred, saint<br>
                                            freedom nailed to the cross of torment</p>
    
                                        <p>freedom gave us tons of tin heroes<br>
                                            and put loads of tin medals in our pockets</p>
    
                                        <p>no way to melt it down<br>
                                            no way to sell it out<br>
                                            to overcome poverty<br>
                                            to overcome one's hunger</p>

                                                <p>we walk and we jingle<br>
                                                    with cheap, tin medals<br>
                                                    and we cannot buy a meal<br>
                                                    for them<br>

                                            and you're armed up to teeth<br>
                                            play the march on pavements<br>
                                            and order to beat the drums</p>
    
                                        <p>'cause rest is nonsense<br>

                                        <p>when there's a time, strike<br>
                                            but straight between the eyes<br>
                                            let the steel crush the bones<br>
                                            until your foe bleeds</p>
    
                                        <p>when there's time to break the statues<br>
                                            it's eager to break them<br>
                                            'cause order came from<br>
                                            the fuhrer or the duce</p>

                                                    there's only starch in potatoes<br>
                                                    a bloody, greasy borscht<br>
                                                    we eat today for lunch<br>
                                                    grab one's throat, like that<br>
                                                    put his mug by the wall<br>
                                                    bend him with the knee<br>
                                                    you're the master now<br>
                                                    and when the blood runs out<br>
                                                    for the disciplined hearts<br>
                                                    drink the blood from others<br>
                                                    and woe to the infidels<br>
                                                    when you will bite the dust<br>
                                                    there would be time to dream<br>
                                                    meanwhile shut your mouth<br>
                                                    and whatch your own shadow</p>

                                          <p>every corner is covered<br>
                                            there's the enemy, the enemy, enemy<br>

                                            So they take the flower of youth for many years now<br>
                                            And when the workers’ blood squirts under heavy tanks<br>
                                            In banks and stocks hallways joyful voices sing:</p>

                                            And when the poor worker will rot in the trenches<br>
                                            The manager earns his money and gets obese</p>

                                                    And when the passionate wave will push you in a frenzy love<br>

                                                    If the Hitler won’t attack</p>

                                                    They will tremble like a milksop<br>
                                                    They only need to dread our power<br>
                                                    If we don’ get hit by Stalin!</p>

                                        <p>On paths between arable fields<br>
                                            In villages where hunger dwells<br>
                                            There bailiff walked with police<br>
                                            And knocked on the peasants' doors<br>
                                            The winter grabs a snow from a sheet<br>
                                            And sows it on the meadows<br>
                                            And the voice in the blizzard calls:<br>
                                            pay, yokel, pay!</p>
    
                                        <p>Pay for the lot<br>
                                            suited just for your grave<br>
                                            clog your starved face<br>
                                            and make money out of your blood<br>
                                            for swine not fed<br>
                                            for plow, for vat<br>
                                            for doorstep, for chimney smoke<br>
                                            - pay, yokel, pay!</p>
    
                                        <p>The landowner holds his grounds<br>
                                            He ships whole woods to sell<br>
                                            The burden of the taxes<br>
                                            Bows down our poor necks<br>
                                            Nothing to wrap our feet<br>
                                            Will we sleep on a snow?<br>
                                            The state ruins us, and floods</p>

                                            <p>pay, scoundrel, pay!</p>

                                        <p>The bailiff haunts the hamlets<br>
                                            The gray, blamished face<br>
                                            strangles us. There's a blue force<br>
                                            For the disobedient ones<br>
                                            The winter walks on plains<br>
                                            And weaves a shirt from snow<br>
                                            The voice in blizzard cries:<br>
                                            Pay, yokel, pay!</p>


                                        <p>They told us: the land is yours again<br>
                                            they told us socage time is over<br>
                                            They know not how much effort one can take<br>
                                            They know not how much effort is in golden spikes<br>
                                            They know not what can peasant's scythe can do</p>

                                            The great prison will be built</p>


                                        <p>They will give me food and drink<br>
                                            In this prison I will rot!<br>
                                        </p>

                                        <p>I don’t want no bolts and bars<br>
                                            I will stray far, far away<br>
                                            I shall take the iron hammer<br>
                                            And join blacksmiths<br>
                                            No bolts and bars</p>

                                       <p>Hit the hammer with us, brother<br>
                                        There’s a work on a chain<br>
                                        Tempered in fire it will be<br>
                                        Your shackles shall be made of it</p>

                                        <p>Executioner waits for my chain<br>
                                            I will carry it for many years</p>

                                                <p>What shall I do, where should I go?<br>
                                                    Shall I eat from hunger a stone<br>
                                                    It is destined for me to be<br>
                                                    Unemployment, famine and cell<br>
                                                    Oh, brother, where should I go?</p>

                                        <p>War? Bring it on. We’ll be delighted.<br>
                                            It does scare anyone no more<br>
                                            A tank will fight with another tank<br>
                                            A cannon with cannon<br>
                                            All without maning</p>
    
                                        <p>But progress, but man's genius?<br>
                                            Even today an empty plane could fly<br>
                                            One can operate ship remotely today<br>
                                            and in ten years?</p>


                                        <p>Empty planes will fight each other<br>
                                            Empty ship will ravage on torpedo ship<br>
                                            But man? what does a man do?<br>
                                            everyone's poisoned anyway</p>

                                            Hits my windows
                                            I get up, fresh and shiny
                                            Shouting anti-state slogan</p>
    
                                        <p>I immerse, up to my eyes
                                            In joyful moral filth
                                            And so I sincerely disparage
                                            to God, to fatherland and humanity</p>


                                        <p>I communize, for an hour
                                            I spill the spirit, and then
                                            Slander a little bit
                                            Or blasphem, if it’s holiday</p>
            
                                        <p>I get back to my home, content
                                            Light as a little birdy
                                            In my quiet apartment
                                            Printing machine awaits</p>

                                        <p>I print and print
                                            Lovely green dollars
                                            Commies leaflets
                                            Pornographic booklets</p>

                    <p class="dics-description">Debiutancka długogrająca płyta zespołu. Materiał został zarejestrowany w Studiu S4 Polskiego Radia pod czujnym okiem Wojciecha Przybylskiego, a nastepnie zmiksowany i zmasterowany przez Jacka Gładkowskiego. Wydawcą albumu jest Antena Krzyku, którą w przedsięwzięciu wspiera Karoryfer Lecolds. Autorami oprawy graficznej albumu są Michał Sitkiewicz i Gabriela Szewczyk (collodion.pl). Słowo wstępne przygotował zaś Ziemowit Szczerek, który na wzmianki o orkiestrze zbuntowanej natykał się niejednokrotnie w międzywojennej prasie.</p>

                                    <p>There's a gendarme walking<br>
                                        fierceful and formal<br>
                                        I'm not affraid of him<br>
                                        'cause he can do nothing to me</p>

                                    <p>He frowns sternly<br>
                                        Fixes his eyes on me<br>
                                        But I'm just whistling<br>
                                        Such a catchy number:</p>

                                    <p>If he asks me<br>
                                        "Why are you whistling"<br>
                                        I will give no answer<br>
                                        'cause I'm an artist!</p>

                                    <p>Even if he suspected me<br>
                                        of worst things possible<br>
                                        He can do nothing to me<br>
                                        'cause I'm a civilian!</p>

                                    <p>Yes, I'm a civilian<br>
                                        What a lovely status<br>
                                        Gendarme is not for me<br>
                                        For me there's the police!</p>

                                    <p>If he asks me...</p>

                                    <p>I will even smile<br>
                                        I will even butter up<br>
                                        With all the gallantry<br>
                                        I'll tell, what I'm whistling against</p>

                                    <p>I'll go to the police station<br>
                                        With all the enthusiasm<br>
                                        'cause that's where I belong<br>
                                        And I know, why I'm there</p>

                                    <p>If he asks me...</p></div>

                                            Down with commies! Down with Jews!<br>
                                            Entire Poland is covered in those</p>

                                            Valiant boys, fascist boys</p>

                                        <p>They fight the Jewish hydra<br>
                                            Nationalists boys arrays<br>

                                            They will put out his vile eyes</p>

                                                So it’s soothing just to watch them<br>
                                                Certainly if not those boys<br>

                                            Are supported by those boys<br>
                                            They even defend the workers<br>
                                            From workers themselves!</p>

                                        <p>Thanks to them the Poland grows<br>
                                            And fullfils its western mission<br>
                                            Even the wealthy Jews<br>
                                            Are helping them in fear</p>

                                        <p>With God’s and German help<br>
                                            They will soon triumph everywhere<br>

                                            While poor people lose their houses, lose their jobs<br>
                                            And people's earnings are so miserable, so crummy</p>

                    <p class="dics-description">About everything that’s happening right now – I’m silent! (Józef Wittlin).
                                Yet, the rebellious orchestra keeps singing. About sailing ships, for which there are no places left (Władysław Szlengel). About the knightly hunt in the shadow of the alcove (Zuzanna Ginczanka). About Polish colonies and Beck’s Island (Tadeusz Hollender). About laundresses with hair like linen who gently wash the thin white (Ginczanka).
                                About wars that have already broken out. About wars that will break out tomorrow (Wittlin).
                                Hańba! Sings the year “1939”.
                                
                        </p>

                        <p class="dics-description">The third album, this time an EP, the orchestra recorded with Marcin Klimczak in Mustache Ministry Studio in Warsaw. Ygrekowski designed 5 covers for each of the 5 songs, which were released with reverence by Antena Krzyku. The lyrics of Zuzanna Ginczanka were sung and complemented with the sound of the violin by Basia Songin, Kasia Kapela and Zosia Zembrzuska, i.e. Sutari (https://www.sutari.pl/).</p>

                                        <p>The ships are sailing through the barrens<br>
                                            Throughout the oceans and the seas<br>
                                            The ships are sailing days and nights<br>
                                            The ships are sailing loaded with refugees<br>
                                            Sailing and sailing here and there<br>
                                            Knocking to every port and gate<br>
                                            But the world is locked and bolted<br>
                                            Cause everywhere they go they read: NO PLACES LEFT<br>
                                                </p>
    
                                        <p>So they stay on those ships<br>
                                            To wander around the ocean depths<br>
                                            Not corsairs, nor pirates,<br>
                                            not heroes, nor ramblers<br>
                                            people with no tomorrow, souls of no one<br>
                                            people spat out of the man all those for<br>
                                            whom there are no places left</p>

                                        <p>The ships are sailing, ships are sailing<br>
                                            Through the azures, through the whirls<br>
                                            The ship is a coffin, not a boat<br>
                                            Azure is black ink<br>
                                            So they sail into this endless cruise<br>
                                            and on the gates the sign says: no places left
                                                </p>

                                        <p>The globe is spinning around<br>
                                                Rich in wonders and resources<br>
                                                Suddenly it stops - is it the weight?<br>
                                                Please step off – no places left
                                                </p>

                                                Into the menacing, winding forests and woods<br>
                                                With their hands woven into harnesses and manes<br>

                                                In the alcove’s clandestine history</p>

                                        <p>With nostrils inflated and bent backs<br>
                                                With lips pursed and focused sight<br>

                                                Worthy of a knight, worthy of a man<br>

                                                In the thickets of the past, like an ant, working hard<br>
                                                They search for the granny, for Jewish gram!

                                        <p class="song-author">by Zuzanna Ginczanka (1917-1945)</p>
                                       
                                        <p>Lala-la, lala-la<br>
                                                Buzzes, buzzes the white foam
                                                </p>
    
                                        <p>Carefully, cautiously,<br>
                                                The laundresses wash the thin white<br>
                                                Trying not to tear the lace<br>
                                                And save up for the bombs</p>

                                        <p>Trying not to rip the flounces<br>
                                                And to build a tank – a tankie<br>
                                                Trying not to destroy the brassiere<br>
                                                To buy a lot of battleshipsies</p>

                                        <p>Clang! Bang! Snip! Snap!<br>
                                                Here, a new fragrant gas grows<br>
                                                Snip! Snap! Thump! Bump!<br>
                                                New, shiny Krupp tanks</p>


                                         <p>A new missile, a fashionable mine,<br>
                                                A new, slim submarine<br>
                                                A new kind of glass candle<br>
                                                Laced, flounced</p>   
                                                
                                                
                                        <p>Lala-la, lala-la<br>
                                                Buzzes, buzzes the black foam</p>


                                        <p>It’s not a laundryroom, not a washtub<br>
                                                (I know, because I’m looking into time and far away)<br>
                                                Those are the infernal, devilish tubs<br>
                                                If I were to be honest-</p>   
                                                
                                                
                                                <p>Clang! Bang! Buzzes, splashes –<br>
                                                        Black oil, greasy tar<br>
                                                        Blood cooling, thick swarms<br>
                                                        Death in trenches, fields and ditches -<br>
                                                        Clang! Bang! Buzzes, splashes<br>
                                                        Above the tar – crackling sulfur<br>
                                                        Demons herd each other to work</p>
        
        
                                                <p>Lala-la, Lala-la<br>
                                                        And in a soft voice are singing<br>
                                                        Lala-la, Lala-la<br>
                                                        The laundresses with hair like linen</p>
